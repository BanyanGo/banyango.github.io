            <p>Worked with Veerum to create their industry leading Virtual Reality Software, where we were the first company to render point clouds in VR at 90fps.
            <p>The creation of this software took me all over the stack from creating build servers that processed data in python to debugging shader assembly code. Lots of interesting new challenges everyday that really played into my ability to work with any tech that is required to get the job done.             
            <ul>
                <li>Industry first Virtual Reality point cloud and CAD visualization application that interfaced with a REST web api using Unity3d.</li>
                <li>Networked Virtual Reality application to allow multiple users to see each other when using the application. This became one of the main demo tools for Veerum, where they could set up at trade shows from Houston to Dubai and walk clients through example data sets from their office in Calgary. This demo method lead to quite a number of sales.</li>
                <li>Build Server for bundling of data and executables using python scripts. Further work was done using python to process point cloud and CAD Data into proprietary data structures.</li>
                <li>Directed the research project into using Web Assembly for CAD visualization in the web browser.</li>
                <li>Worked on a Rust proof of concept point cloud data structure algorithm to be brought in through FFI into unity and web assembly. This allowed common data structure code to be shared between the web versions and the unity code.</li>                                            
                <li>SR&ED documentation for Veerum's claim.</li>

                <li>Used Java 8 to decouple our database layer from the domain layer. Resulting in the ability to use
                    mocking. This increased the speed from running a full suite of tests from days to minutes.
                </li>
                <li>Drove implementation of Agile processes on our team. Helped bring Sprint Planning/Story point/User Story techniques into the

                <li>I'm really into game jams. If you're not familiar it's a hack-a-thon where you create a game from scratch in a set period of time. My favourite is Ludum Dare. I've participated in the last 25 events. You can check out some of my entries here https://banyango.itch.io/ all of them were created in 48 hours.</li>
                <li>Music is another thing you can usually find me doing. I play multiple instruments and I'm big into creating my own music for games. If you'd like to check some of it out you can find some of it here https://banyango.bandcamp.com/</li>
